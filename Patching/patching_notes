But here is the basic idea:
1. "Apps" is an _ordered_ list of steps to start and stop "applications"
2. Stop order would be in reverse
3. cmdtype:menu == fixed set of commands, startapp, stopapp, verifyapp
4. cmdtype:init    == standard system "service" commands

5. cmdtype:script == more of a band-aid or swiss-army-knife (depends upon perspective)
            This provides ability to execute custom commands
    a. start+stop+verify to be delinked
    b. execute the step only if "start" or "stop" specified in given run
    c. skip verify if not specified

So, potentially, we can have.
        { "cmdtype": "script", "start": "/local/app/b2b/startme" }
        { "cmdtype": "script", "start": "sleep 300", "verify":"/local/app/b2b/verify_started" }
or even,
       { "cmdtype": "script", "start": "true", "verify":"/local/app/b2b/verify_started" }
