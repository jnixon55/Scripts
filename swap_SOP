We are currently seeing swap warnings on serveral of our servers in our environment. For the most part this is because the swap file
is fairly small at 1GB and because the monitoring is looking for a percentage used if a server has over 500mb swap it will alert.
After running 'vmstat 3 100', I confirmed that the app is not "swapping" and that the swap usage is legitimate.
My suggestion is to add annother 1GB swap file (Making swap 2GB) this should be prevent the monitoring from alerting for swap usage when only
500mb of swap is being used.

*If you notice that you have serveral GB of swap and you are running out of swap and/or you notice that the app is "swapping", further investigation is needed.
